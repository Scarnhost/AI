# AI project

The primary aim of project is to implement sliding window algorithm for K-clustering
algorithm using Python programming language. The algorithms will be designed to handle 
continuous data streams and efficiently update the clustering results as new data points
arrive.

We have taken inspiration from research paper published in NeurIPS 2020.
