## Lab Project
The primary aim of project is to implement sliding window algorithm for K-clustering
algorithm using the Python programming language. The algorithms will be designed to handle 
continuous data streams and efficiently update the clustering results as new data points
arrive.

We have taken inspiration from a research paper published in NeurIPS 2020.

The following dependencies are required for this program to run:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Design Project
Implemented Pix2Pix paper on two datasets, with some improvements on basic nature. Please refer to the [report](https://github.com/Scarnhost/AI/blob/main/Lab%20Project%20-%20Pix2Pix/CRISPReportPix2Pix.pdf).
